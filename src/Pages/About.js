              <p>
                My journey into design and development started with a simple curiosity 
                about how things work. I was fascinated by the intersection of technology 
                and human behavior, which led me to explore both the creative and technical 
                aspects of digital product creation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with amazing teams and 
                clients, each project teaching me something new about user needs, business 
                goals, and the art of problem-solving through design and code.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, I continue to push boundaries, experiment with new technologies, 
                and create products that not only look beautiful but also solve real 
                problems for real people.
