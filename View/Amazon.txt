Before/After 

Before
Cluttered Layout: Overwhelming amount of promotions and banners with no clear visual hierarchy.

Small Icons: Category icons (e.g., Mobiles, Deals) are small and crowded in a horizontal scroll.

Busy Backgrounds: Bright colors and overlapping elements make the interface visually noisy.

Poor Readability: Text sizes vary with inconsistent spacing, making content hard to scan quickly.



After 
Cleaner Layout: Improved structure with clearly separated sections and breathing space.

Prominent Categories: Main categories (e.g., Home, Mobiles, Electronics) shown as large, tappable icons.

Focused Callouts: Sections like “Pick Up Where You Left Off” and “Budget Store” guide user action better.

Better Visual Hierarchy: Fonts, colors, and layout create a smoother flow and easier navigation.
