Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 Introduction:
Our project is about creating a system where companies can easily outsource tasks. Companies upload their tasks to the platform, and students can take on these tasks, complete them, and submit their work. The companies then review the submissions, choose the best one, and reward that student with payment. Other students who meet the task standards also get certified for their work, which helps them gain recognition and build their skills.
1.2 Motivation:
For Companies: Many businesses face challenges in finding cost-effective and creative solutions for their tasks. This platform provides a straightforward way to connect with talented students who can deliver innovative results.
For Students: Students often struggle to get practical experience that shows off their abilities. This platform gives them a chance to solve real-world problems, gain recognition, and enhance their resumes.
For Both: By connecting companies and students, this platform creates a win-win situation. Companies get quality work, and students get valuable experience and rewards.
1.3 Problem Definition: 
Outsourcing is a common practice for companies in order to save time and cut some costs, but it is not as easy as it seems. A lot of businesses struggle with the proper selection of personnel, assurance of high-quality work, or effective process management. Traditional options such as freelancers or agencies are expensive and require a lot of effort.
But students have problems of their own. They want to get practice and show their skills, yet the chances to do that are limited. Most platforms don't recognize the effort of all contributors in a fair way. Usually, only a so-called "best" work is remunerated, while others who tried hard have nothing to show for it.
This project attempts to fill that gap. On one side, companies seek an easier and more accessible method of outsourcing their tasks, while students seek opportunities to learn, grow, and be acknowledged for their efforts. This project thus resolves problems on either side by creating a clear and open platform that favors companies and students alike.
1.4 Proposed System overview:
1.4.1 Objectives
Providing a platform that will connect the students with real-life projects in the field of study.
Make it easier for companies to outsource tasks.
Give students opportunities to gain experience and showcase their skills.
Create a fair system for evaluating work and rewarding excellence.
Recognize quality work by issuing certificates to students.
1.4.2 Scope
Primary Functions: The platform will enable the easiest way of uploading tasks by companies, specifying their requirements, and reviewing student submissions. Companies will also be allowed to choose the best submissions for payment, and other submissions will receive feedback.
Student Engagement: View available tasks, submit completed work, and check the status of submissions. They will get feedback on performance and a certificate for completion of tasks correctly done, including time spent on each task.
Task Evaluation System: The platform will also provide a clear review system wherein the companies can evaluate all submissions against set criteria. In this way, even the work of the students that is not selected will be evaluated constructively.
1.4.3 Opportunities
 It enhances the employability factor among students by adding practical exposure to their relevant industry.
Saves outsourcing costs and brings fresh lots of talent onboard for companies to work on their projects.
 Highly replicable model across geographies and industries
Diversification of student's skill sets and professional networks.

1.5 Proposed system constraints and Assumption:
1.5.1 Constraints
The platform has to balance demands of academic loads with the availability of work so as not to overload its students with more than they can handle.
Companies may also have a minimum skill level requirement or minimum experience which would narrow down the pool available, maybe leaving out the younger body of students.
Legal and contractual constraints regarding student labor and intellectual property have to be treated carefully, ethically.
1.5.2 Assumptions
Companies are willing to outsource tasks to students more cheaply for flexibility.
Students want to work practically but to a great extent make some earnings during their studies.
There may be a reception of this step within the institutions as it is in line with career building.
The system may attract adequate demand within the two parties involved so that its viability can be achieved.
 
1.6 System Stakeholders
1.6.1 Primary Stakeholders
Students: The clients who require flexible and practical work
Companies: The employers who need to outsource certain tasks at a lower rate.
1.6.2 Secondary Stakeholders:
 Training institutions - universities and colleges can support the platform as part of their placement services.
Government and labor organizations may be interested in compliance with labor laws and in increasing employability among students.
Investors: If the platform is a business venture, potential investors will be interested in its success and financial viability.
1.7 Required Tools
We'll be building a scalable and strong platform for connecting students with companies by mixing together different frontend and backend tools, also involving design. Here are some tools and technologies:
Frontend Development:
ReactJS: A popular JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
Redux: A state management library to efficiently manage complex application state.
React Router: For handling navigation and routing within the application.
Material-UI or Ant Design: UI component libraries to accelerate development and ensure consistent design.

Table 1.1 swot analysis
1.9 Development Approach
The development shall be iterative and agile. The idea is to design, for this first version, a very basic platform with core functionalities that can enable matching between students and companies. The platform shall then be improved through iterations to come based on early users' feedback, students and companies, further continuous updating and enhancement based on user experience, market demand, and technological advancement.
Chapter 2: Requirement Analysis and Specifications
2.1 Introduction
The main objective of this chapter is to give a concise idea about the system and the progress activities taken for the development of the work. The functional and non-functional requirements of the system, together with the user requirements, will be elaborated in detail. Also, an overall description of the system is included. In short, this chapter focuses on the analysis phase of the system development life cycle
2.2 Requirements identification:
2.2.1 Interactive techniques:
To gather the required functions from both parties and gain a deeper understanding of their needs and perspectives, we are employing a multifaceted approach involving interviews with both company workers and students, as well as conducting comprehensive surveys among students.

Interviewee: Ehab el sherif, Co-founder & Executive Producer of Morph Studios
Interviewer: Abdelrahman mohamed, student 
Attendees: Abdelrahman Tamer, Abdelrahman Amr
Date: Sunday, 17 November.
Location: Remote
Q1
How would this software help you as an organization?
A1
I need recommendations to ensure that the work will be done successfully. As a freelancer, I’m often on tight deadlines, so I need to hire someone who can start immediately without spending time verifying their qualifications.
Q2
Is certification and GPA mandatory for you?
A2
It depends on the task. For example, in graphic design, if a person is creative but lacks the technical skills to execute the design, it won’t be helpful.
Q3
Is splitting tasks with students a compromise for you?
A3
It depends on the industry. In my case, as a production house, I can split tasks during the off-season. However, during peak times, I will be more selective. The idea of splitting tasks is manageable if the timing is right.


Q4
How would you like tasks to be displayed to ensure they reach the most relevant audience
A4
I prefer to post tasks visible only to those in the relevant field. 
Q5
Do you prefer a bidding system or choosing from completed work?
A5
I prefer selecting from completed work, as it allows me to directly assess the results and make more selective decisions.
Q6
How do you like to negotiate with students?
A6
I prefer to contact students via phone or at least WhatsApp. Chat within the app might be too time-consuming and less efficient, depending on the UI.
Q7
Who will review the tasks? And how would you rate them after completion?
A7
I want to be the decision-maker throughout the process, from start to finish, without needing verification from others before the final approval.
Q8
What level of security do you need?
A8
Students should only have access to the company’s information, not the client’s details.
Q9
What information do you need from the students?
A9
Contact information is sufficient.
Q10
Can your tasks be done remotely?
A10
It depends on the task. For example, video editing requires large files that are difficult to upload or download remotely. In such cases, working on-site is preferable, as I cannot trust students with sensitive materials.
Q11
How do you trust a student?
A11
 I would prefer a ranking and rating system for students to gauge their reliability and performance.

This is the Homepage, serving as the entry point for users to understand the platform and access key actions such as logging in or registering.
The "Login" button redirects to the Login/Registration Page.
The "Register Now" button directs users to the Registration Form Page.



This is the Login/Registration Page, where users can select their role and proceed to log in or register.
Selecting "For Students" redirects to the Student Registration Form Page or Student Dashboard after login.
Selecting "For Companies" redirects to the Company Registration Form Page or Company Dashboard after login.
A back arrow allows users to return to the Homepage.

.




This is the Registration Form Page, allowing users to sign up by entering their details.
Students completing the form are redirected to the Featured Tasks Page (Student Dashboard).
Companies completing the form are redirected to the Company Dashboard.
A back arrow lets users return to the Login/Registration Page.



This is the Featured Tasks Page, which acts as the main dashboard for students, showcasing available tasks for completion.
Clicking "View" on a task redirects to the Task Details Page.
The header includes links to informational pages and settings for profile management or logout.



Featured Tasks Page
Purpose:
This page serves as the main dashboard for students, showcasing a list of tasks available for completion. It is designed to provide quick access to tasks and their details.
Description: The layout is divided into three primary sections:
Header: Contains the student's profile information, such as their name and endorsement level.
Includes navigation links ("How it works," "About us," "Help") and an icon for account settings or login.
Task Listings: Displays featured tasks in a list format.
Each task includes the following details:
Task name
Company name
Short description of the task
A "View" button to access more details.
Search and Filters:
Located on the right-hand side.
Provides a search bar for finding specific tasks.
Includes filters to refine search results (e.g., by category, difficulty, or deadline).
Navigation:
Students can click the "View" button on any task to open a detailed task description.
The header links lead to informational or support pages.

The storyboard "Submit a Proposal" starts when the user selects one of the tasks from the task list; this opens the view of the task detail. Then, clicking the "Submit a Proposal" button opens a pop-up form where the user can insert a proposal description, attach supportive documentation, and complete other information. After reviewing the information, the user can click either "Submit" to send the proposal or "Cancel" to discard it. The system allows input validation: in case some fields are not filled in, an error message appears, and in case of successful submission, a confirmation message appears. After that, the user is forwarded to the task list or task details page for further navigation.

The confirmation of submission screen must be able to indicate to a user whether or not the submitted proposal has been successful through the checkmark icon and, for clarity, "Your submission was added." One "Back to Dashboard" button will take the user back to the main interface where he/she can take further actions. Other navigation options such as "How it Works," "About Us," and "Help" are at the top right for further guidance. This page gives a successful confirmation and makes sure that navigation back to the platform is smooth.








6.1 Conclusions
In summary, this project effectively meets the essential demand for a streamlined platform that connects businesses and students for task outsourcing. Utilizing essential features like managing company and student profiles, publishing tasks and tracking contributions, integrating payments, and handling notifications, the system provides a smooth and user-friendly experience for both stakeholders. 
The incorporation of essential processes such as certificate creation, task assessment, and dashboard analytics illustrates the platform's dedication to improving students' professional development while fulfilling the operational requirements of businesses. Moreover, the incorporation of a strong notification system and payment transaction module guarantees transparency and dependability across the platform. 
This initiative not only simplifies task outsourcing but also promotes a reciprocal relationship between businesses and students, allowing for skill enhancement, career exposure, and effective task completion. Upcoming versions of the system may investigate enhanced functionalities like AI-driven task suggestions, live collaboration tools, and more comprehensive analytics for better decision-making and user contentment. 
This platform establishes a robust basis for linking academia and industry by tackling real-world issues and offering creative solutions, fostering improved collaboration and productivity.
